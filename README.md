# Market-Research-on-Tesla-Inc

Created a market research proposal for a client brief provided by Tesla. The market research proposal aims to
achieve sustainable growth for Tesla by fulfilling their business objectives. The research focuses on
understanding driver attitudes, brand perceptions, consumer appetites and evolving trends in the electric vehicle
industry. An efficient method of carrying out the research is proposed along with different data analysis
techniques, such as ANOVA, cross tabulations and Factor Analysis, that would be helpful in analysing the
behaviour of Tesla and non-Tesla customers. Two different questionnaires were too made for both Tesla and
non -Tesla customers.
